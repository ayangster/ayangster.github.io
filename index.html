								<h2>What's world peas?</h2>
								<p>In Chinese culture, you're given both a formal Chinese name, composed of three syllables and led with your family name, and a <a href="https://www.yoyochinese.com/blog/how-nicknames-work-in-Chinese">小名</a>, which translated literally means "small name." Mine is 豆豆 (dòu dòu), which means peas. Legend has it, when I was a toddler, I spilled a bowl of peas at my grandparents' house, and my grandfather lovingly bequeathed me the nickname. In full transparency (and a secret I'd really rather take to the grave rather than divulge to those who know less), I believe it also means pimple. There, I've bared my soul to you -- we now have a bond you'll have to take with you throughout the rest of your magnificent existence.</p>

								<h2>What will I find here?</h2>
								<p>Honestly, your guess is as good as mine. My intention is to share: musings I'm not embarrassed to digitize, career thoughts, and a few piano recordings if I can figure out how to transfer music from CDs (<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/CD-ROM.png">what are those??</a>). My hope is that this will take on a natural life of its own and I have a few ideas in the works for the upcoming year.</p>
